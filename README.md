### Recommendations and Next Steps
* Investigate what issues unsatisifed customers have with Customer Service Responsiveness and implement changes based on frequent issues that are reported. 
* Continue to maintain competitive pricing and emphasize pricing in marketing strategy to push potential customers away from competitors
* To improve user engagement and overall satisfaction, enhance personalized recommendation systems by reviewing the customer data quality/volume that influences Machine Learning (ML) Models and also look into improving ML algorithms being used (collaborative-filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid models)
* Since trusting review accuracy is also likely to lead to more user engagement and overall satisfaction, look into improving AI systems that detect fake reviews as well as making sure that human moderators are equipped with the best tools to spot fake reviews
