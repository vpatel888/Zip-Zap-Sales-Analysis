### Recommendations and Next Steps
* The highest and lowest revenue occured in the same months that had the highest and lowest transactions, so look into increasing the number of transactions of customers by implementing loyalty programs, referral programs, email reminders, etc. Also consider possible price-adjustments during those months if appropriate.
* Since September had the lowest ATV and the lowest Revenue, consider strategies to boost ATV such as upselling, placing items near the checkout, and encouraging employees to be enthusastic and attentive to customers' needs.
* Since Electronics bring in the most revenue, consider placing more focus on the promotion of products within this category.
